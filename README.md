### Process

#### Original Idea / Sketches & Wireframes
We had been tasked to work in groups to build a website / application together. We decided to create and app that would be the perfect festival companion. Prior to starting the build, we spent a lot of time creating extremely detailed, clickable wireframes. Please [click here](https://marvelapp.com/428e1e4) to view the wireframes

#### Blockers & Bugs
Working as a team made it a lot more interesting while working on a project. This would come down to small details such a naming conventions. We were able to overcome this problem with increasing our communication and having coding sessions as a group.

#### Wins
My biggest win was getting a location tracker into the app. This is on the profile page and will always pick up your current location, as well as displaying it on a map.

### Future Features
#### Location Sharing & Directions
One aspect that we had planned on building but ran out of time was to do a locations sharing feature within the app. This would allow a user to share their location with a friend and the friend would be able to follow the maps with directions to the friend. Similarly we also wanted user to be able to drop markers within the app so they could mark important locations such as stages, toilets or their tent. Each would allow the user to get directions from their current location back to where they have dropped the marker on the map.
